# Kalbe_Nutritional
The repository is a project-based internship organized by Rakamin Academy in collaboration with Kalbe Nutritional. In this project, I take on the role of a data scientist and learn to solve problems and work on projects that align with the activities of Kalbe Nutritional company.

The project I am working on originates from the inventory and marketing teams.
<h1><b>Problem Statement:</b></h1>

<li>Knowing the estimated quantity of products sold, the inventory team can create sufficient daily stock supplies.</li>
<li>The prediction should be done on a daily basis.</li></ul>
